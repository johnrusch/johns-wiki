As I was leaving with coffees and food, I saw a family who are regulars there sitting outside. I went over to them to say hello before I left.</p>
<p>Their son had grown quite a bit since I’d last seen them. He was getting frustrated trying to tell me something, not wanting help from his parents. After he was done, his parents and I shared how we’d been doing lately and other brief pleasantries. In a lull in our conversation, the dad said, “well, don’t want your coffees to get cold.” Meaning that I should probably leave, which was fine with me. There really wasn’t much else to say and it wasn’t like our conversation was really taking off. So I said bye, hope they have a nice day, whatever.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that we feel inclined to come up with reasons why we say goodbye.</p></section><section class="w-full h-64 mt-4 mb-4 box-border sm:flex-1 sm:h-full sm:ml-4"><img src="/_astro/resized_IMG_0692.JPG.8ca79ed1_Z1sc8v1.webp" class="w-full h-full object-cover sm:h-full sm:object-contain sm:object-center" alt="a child in a power ranger's costume walking away" width="2067" height="2611" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></section></main><footer class="footer"><a href="https://github.com/johnrusch" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="footer-link"><img src="/_astro/githubIcon.19d61e30_Z95OD.webp" class="footer-icon" alt="Github" width="489" height="486" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-r-54a012184/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="footer-link"><img src="/_astro/linkedinIcon.56637b69_1VQePt.webp" class="footer-icon" alt="LinkedIn" width="357" height="353" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a></footer></body></html>
